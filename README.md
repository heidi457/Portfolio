# portfolio - Heidi R.
Welcome to my portfolio!
As i go thorugh my bootcamp journey with Northwestern I will be updating my personal portfolio. 
At the naked eye it may not seem as much, but I was able to build it from scratch and show off my CSS & HTML skills. 


I was able to configure and adjust the CSS for all body parts in the HTML file. 
For example:
- header
- intro
- about me
- my work
- projects 1-3
- footer

Please, make sure to check out my two projects that I have completed so far!
The images should direct you to those projects.
